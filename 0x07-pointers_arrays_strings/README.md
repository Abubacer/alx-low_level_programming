#C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

##Learning Objectives

At the end of this project, we are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

    * What are pointers and how to use them
    * What are multidimensional arrays and how to use them
    * What are the most common C standard library fuctions to manipulate strings
